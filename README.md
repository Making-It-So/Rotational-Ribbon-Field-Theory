# SRFT-R: Rotational Ribbon Field Theory (Compact Save Bundle)

A symbolic physics framework where rotating, space-filling ribbons form programmable logic fields, simulate quantum and hadronic phenomena, and model spacetime curvature through resonance and twist.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Ribbon**: A 2D phase object with torque, twist, and rotational state
- **Sheet**: Infinite array of ribbons that can rotate, shear, and fuse
- **Giggle**: A 3-ribbon coherence packet (analogous to a hadron)
- **SCSLE+ Gate**: Symbolic fusion gate requiring:
  - Phase alignment: Φ < π/10
  - Torque mode match: |ν_qᵢ − ν_qⱼ| < ε
  - Rotational match: Δθᵢⱼ < ε

## SRFT-R Lagrangian

ℒ_SRFT-R =  
½μ(∂ₜR)²  
− ½λ(∇R)²  
− ½κ(∇²R)²  
− γ(∂ₜθ⃗)²  
− η(Δθ⃗ᵢⱼ)²  
− V(R)

## SSFML: Sample Logic Program

DEFINE RIBBON R1 WITH OMEGA 1.00e8 ROTATION [θx, θy] DEFINE SHEET S1 FORM GIGGLE G1 FROM R1 R2 R3

FIELD B1 TYPE MAGNETIC PROFILE Sin[2π * 1e8 * t] APPLY B1 TO G1

IF SCSLE+ == TRUE THEN ROTLOCK G1

---

## Simulation Summary

- `spinlockJoin` gate fuses giggles only if torque, phase, and rotation align
- Rotating sheet bundles simulate hadron fusion, qubit logic, and symbolic field memory
- Infinite stacked PRC sheets model cosmic-scale field geometry
